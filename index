      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Public and International Affairs at City University of Hong Kong. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in July 2023. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before entering academia, I was deeply engaged in grassroots governance for 5 years. 
        In 2012, I began working as a college village official in Wuhan, where I narrowly avoided injury during clashes with protesters 
        over the demolition of an industrial park. This incident prompted me to question how developing countries integrate sources of 
        instability into formal political institutions. Later, as a civil servant in Guangzhou (2013–2017), I observed how well-institutionalized 
        online petition channels provided partial solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences led me to ask a big question: <em>How can a revolutionary regime move from a campaign-style governance to a more 
        institutionalized form of governance?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary research focus is on political institutions and public policies in China. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My methodological interests include computational social science (including web scraping, text mining, image analysis, and social network analysis), survival analysis (also known as event history analysis), panel data analysis, and survey data analysis.
